Country Module's Documentation
==============================

The country module (inspired by Tryton) installs subdivisions 
(states, counties, regions, federal states, and in some cases districts as well) 
of a country to the Open ERP database. 

.. note:: By default Open ERP comes packed with only subdivisions of the United States of America and does not use ISO codes.
